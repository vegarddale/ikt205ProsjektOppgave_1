# ikt205ProsjektOppgave_1

this project is a todolist app as part of ikt205 at University of Agder.
the app has a login page where you can either sign in with google and firebase or anonymously. both options allow for persistant data storage using firebase.
the app has an overview of all the lists you add with a progress bar showing the progress which updates when u check off items in the list. you can delete and add lists with the names you want.
to get to the details of the list just click somewhere inside the outline of the list and you will be navigated to the items of the clicked list.
this app is developed using mostly androix components:
navigation for navigating between fragments with navigation arguments
recycler view for recycling view components
viewmodel for sharing data between fragments
and a worker for the uploading and downloading from firebase
